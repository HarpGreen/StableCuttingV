# StableCuttingV
Turn a end face turning program to S-changing &amp; stable cutting velocity by inserting different rotation speed.

This program was used in our Labtory to apply stable cutting speed end face turning.

We generate normal programs just like the "inpgm.txt", we need to change the S to achieve stable cutting speed V, this program was used to insert different S parameters to the program.

WARNING : U must set the parameter "sLimit" carefully!!! An inappropriate rotation limit can easily cause DANGER!
